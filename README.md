## Fibonacci Heap Implementation in C++

### Overview

This project implements a Fibonacci Heap in C++, a data structure that supports a collection of priority queue operations with better amortized time complexities than other heap structures such as binary or binomial heaps. Fibonacci Heaps are particularly efficient for algorithms that repeatedly extract the minimum value and insert new elements, such as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

### Features

- **Insertion**: Add a new node to the heap.
- **Find Minimum**: Retrieve the node with the smallest key.
- **Extract Minimum**: Remove and return the node with the smallest key.
- **Decrease Key**: Decrease the key of a given node.
- **Delete Node**: Remove a node from the heap.
- **Union**: Merge two Fibonacci Heaps into a single heap.
